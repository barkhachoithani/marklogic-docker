MarkLogic on Docker Early Access (EA) Notices:

- MarkLogic Docker images belonging to the EA program follow a specific tagging format: `{ML release version}-{platform}-{ML Docker release version}-ea`
- This software is intended for use with a valid MarkLogic Developer license. See: https://developer.marklogic.com/free-developer/
- EA Docker artifacts provide only a subset of features that are planned for the General Availability release.
- Final packaging of artifacts has not yet been determined. The inclusion of a feature in the EA release does not guarantee that feature will ship as a part of the General Availability release.
- The EA build may not be as functionally complete as the final General Availability release. Known limitations will be documented as completely as possible.
- Documentation will be limited; some features may only be documented by example, and some of the documentation may be incomplete.
- While we are highly motivated to get your feedback, EA is not a program that will be supported through our formal support processes. Product support will only be available through a community mailing list of those people involved in the EA program. Individuals from the MarkLogic product team will respond on an as-possible basis to address questions and issues raised by the community. Issues raised through the mailing list will be visible to all members of the community. The community support mailing list for MarkLogic on Docker is: docker@marklogic.com
- All rights to use the EA release of MarkLogic on Docker will expire 30 days after the end of the EA program.
